# Project-Gowri
hey there, i am Gowri shree kumar currently a data annotator going to become an ETL tester. so i was asked to do a project on sql with four tasks. 
I used the database Postgresql to finish my projects. 

the projects are:

task 1: Academic management system- the aim is to create a system that allows for managing student information and course enrollment. It involves three tables:
Studentinfo
Coursesinfo
enrollmentinfo

Task 2: Student management system- design and implementation of a student database management system to store and retrieve student information efficiently.

Task 3: Event management system- to develop the application that allows users to create and manage events, track attendees, and handle event registration efficiently. It includes three tables:
Events
Attendees
registrations

Task 4: OLAP operations- to perform various OLAP operations, namely:
Drill down,
Rollup,
Cube,
Slice,
dice.

i have implemented the fundamental concepts and skills of 
1. creating database and tables,
2. inserting and manipulating data,
3. querying and filtering data, aggregating and analysing data,
4. data manipulation and transformation.
